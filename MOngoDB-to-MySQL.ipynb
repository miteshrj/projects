I have to admit that I am very impressed with the picture quality and the ease of installation. Best of all, I was able to tear out the plastic screen protector from my Otterbox defender case and use the case without issue. So why did I give it 4 stars? Because of the home button sticker! The sticker is a lame plastic blob that sits on the home button and looks ugly. I thought little of it because I would bury it under the frame of the Otterbox case. Unfortunately it causes slight problems with the use of the home button. If I press for slightly too long (a second) it activates siri.
